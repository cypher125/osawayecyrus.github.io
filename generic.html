									<h1>About<br />

									<p>Hello, I'm Cyrus!.<br />
										As a passionate and dedicated full-stack web developer and Python enthusiast,<br />
										I welcome you to my portfolio.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pro_pic3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>With a strong foundation in web development and expertise in Python programming, I strive to create impactful and engaging digital experiences.</p>
								<p>I have always been captivated by the world of technology and its potential to transform ideas into reality. My journey began with a fascination for coding, which led me to pursue a career in web development. Over the years, I have immersed myself in mastering the art of crafting dynamic and user-friendly web solutions. Driven by a thirst for knowledge, I continually seek to expand my skill set and stay up to date with the latest industry trends. My proficiency extends to front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and bootstrap enabling me to create captivating interfaces that provide seamless user experiences. On the back end, I excel in php, mysql and frameworks like Django and Flask, harnessing their power to build robust and scalable applications. Python is my language of choice, as its versatility allows me to solve complex problems efficiently and elegantly.</p>
								<p>Throughout my professional journey, I have had the privilege of working on diverse projects that have challenged and sharpened my skills. From developing dynamic e-commerce platforms to creating interactive web applications, each project has allowed me to push the boundaries of what's possible and deliver exceptional results. I take great pride in my ability to collaborate effectively with clients, designers, and fellow developers, ensuring that projects are executed flawlessly and aligned with the vision of stakeholders. In addition to my technical expertise, I prioritize user experience and interface design. I believe that a well-crafted website goes beyond functionality; it should engage, inspire, and leave a lasting impression. By incorporating best practices in UX/UI design, I strive to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that resonate with users. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid learner and a firm believer in lifelong education. I actively participate in online communities, attend workshops and conferences, and engage in continuous learning to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving web development landscape. This commitment to personal growth allows me to offer innovative solutions that push boundaries and meet the unique needs of each project. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I invite you to dive into my projects, witness the impact of my work firsthand, and envision the possibilities we can achieve together. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out. I look forward to connecting with you and embarking on exciting ventures together.</p>
